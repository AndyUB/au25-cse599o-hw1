Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot liked to play in the park with his friends. They liked to run, jump, and roll in the grass.
One sunny day, Spot and his friend, a cat named Fluffy, decided to play hide and seek. They wanted to find a good place to hide. Spot started to lead Fluffy to a big tree. They ran and hid in the grass.
After a while, they found a big hole. The hole was hidden behind the tree. Spot was curious too. They decided to look for a place to hide. They found a hidden place in the hole. Spot barked, "I found a fit place to hide!"
Fluffy and Spot ran to find a good hiding place. They found a small hole in the hole. They jumped in and played, having fun. They forgot all about being ignorant about their hidden home. They were happy to have each other as friends.
