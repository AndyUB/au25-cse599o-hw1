Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot liked to get ready for a new day. One day, while Spot was rushing to a big party, he saw a cage with a lock on it.
Spot ran inside to find his food. He found his favorite food, cheese, and a big cake. Spot ate and ate until he heard a loud splash. It was his friend, Cat, coming to visit him.
From that day on, Spot and Cat decided to play a fun game of hide and seek. They laughed and had lots of fun together. Spot was a clever dog who loved to help Cat with the chores. At the end of the day, they were very tired but happy.
